<h1>Homework 5 - Trivia Game (Advanced)</h1>
Homework description: 
- Create a trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.
- If the player selects the correct answer, show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, display the next question -- do this without user input.
- The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.
- If the player runs out of time, tell the player that time's up and display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
- If the player chooses the wrong answer, tell the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
- On the final screen, show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).

First, you got to have music. So I added the Stranger Things theme song in my html. 

Second, I created a jumbotron with a gif that only loops once so it's not super annoying.

Third, cute waffle to tell the user that this is an exciting trivia game.

Fourth, I created a button to start the game. 

Before I get to Javascript, the CSS was simple. I overrided some bootstrap themes to make it look more dark and ominious like the TV show. I fixed the sizing of the images used in the game, including the ones that appear only with Javascript. Bootstrap wasn't cooperating too well with the heading gif, so I included some media queries to make the game more mobile friendly. 

<h2>Javascript</h2>
I have provided step-by-steps in my .js file.
